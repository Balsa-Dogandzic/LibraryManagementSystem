# LibraryManagementSystem

System for managing a library written in Java programming language and MySQL database

## Motivation

This is a hobby/resume project

## Setup

You can run this project on your local machine by first installing the archive of this project from this repository or just cloning the repository. All java files are in the `\src` folder but before you run the application you must import the SQL script. The script can be found in `\dependencies` folder, now just create a database with the same name as the script. Now you can run the `Main` class file in the source folder.
